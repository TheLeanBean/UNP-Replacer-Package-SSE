Port: 
- This is an author port of the UNP Armor Replacer Package; 5,140 ENDORSEMENTS; 59,692 UNIQUE D/LS.
- This was ported using SSE NIF Optimizer.
- I consider this release to be the BETA Version of this mod.
- What was the Alpha? I installed all my defaults and ran through my Madd Haven mod without issue.
- Please use the above Bugs section to report an issue.  What model and what it is doing is great.
- Even Better, download and use Madd Haven. 
- You can see all the models there and it would allow you to give me a very specific:
- Bandit 2 is missing a texture on the skirt using remodeled armors

Development continues into SE
- Thank you  to TheLeanBean who has made the 6.0.0 patch.

Summary
- This mod is an installer package (NMM/MO/FOMOD) that combines several armor packages into one. 
- You can then select each armor type from each package. 
- Screenshots are included in the installer to assist in your decisions.

- If you can't decide, option 1 is always selected as my favorite. 
- You could, if you wanted to, hit the next button really fast and install this in 1 minute. 
- Or you can spend an hour deciding your style.
- Note, version 4.0.0 still has my 3.2.0 preferences if you were relying on Author's Choice you will want to pay additional attention when upgrading the clothing section.

Madd Haven Testing Grounds
- You are STRONGLY encouraged to download and use Madd Haven in conjunction with any armor replacer mods (like this one).
- Why? Madd Haven adds a MCM menu entry that can teleport you to several testing grounds where you can see all the armor / clothing.
- This is important to make sure your mix and match, mixes and matches well!

What is the scope or focus of this mod?
- The intent of this mod is to offer choices in what parts of an armor pack you install. 
- This is a replacer armor pack and only contains replacements to the Vanilla Armor/Clothing to match the UNP mesh.
- It only covers the UNP mesh.

How do I install this?
- You must use a mod organizer like NMM or MO.
- I have tested in both the above two mod organizers.
- Anything else is untested, but should work if it uses the normal FOMOD install pack.
- *Note* this mod is not intended for manual installation.
- If you would like to do a manual installation, you are best served by downloading the individual mods.
